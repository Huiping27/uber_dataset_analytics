This project is about the analysis of the Uber Peru. The datasource is Kaggle. I'll analyse the Uber Dataset from three data types: geo, temporal and user. Afterwards, linear regression and randome forest will be employed to train a machine learning model to predict the price. Based on these, I'll develop a web application and create a simple API.
